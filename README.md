# 🌬️ Wind Power Generation Forecasting with Machine Learning

This project focuses on forecasting wind power generation using machine learning models. Accurate prediction of wind energy production is crucial for grid reliability, energy planning, and effective integration of renewables into the power system.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📘 Notebooks Overview

### 1. `EDA.ipynb`
- Visualizes trends in wind speed, power output, and other meteorological factors.
- Identifies seasonal patterns, outliers, and feature correlations.
- Aids in understanding data quality and initial insights.

### 2. `preprocessing.ipynb`
- Handles missing values, performs feature engineering, and scales the data.
- Encodes time-based variables and prepares datasets for machine learning models.

### 3. `model_training.ipynb`
- Trains and evaluates machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Uses metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² score to assess performance.
- Performs cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
